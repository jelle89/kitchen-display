# Kitchen display

## (If you are in this folder):
- cd ../server
- npm install
- cd ../client
- npm install

## *open two tabs of your terminal*

## terminal 1:
- cd server
- nodemon index

## terminal 2:
- cd client
- npm run start


p.s. I have added the updated kitchen.sql file in the server folder, created_at and updated_at are now createdAt and updatedAt.
